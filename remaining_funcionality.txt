1. Implement Hopcroft's Algorithm for DFA Minimization

The current minimization method is just a placeholder. Implementing the full Hopcroft's algorithm would make the program complete.
This would reduce the DFA to its minimal form with the fewest possible states.


2. Add State Renaming

After conversion or minimization, rename states to a more readable format (q0, q1, etc.).
This would make the resulting automaton easier to understand.


3. Remove asking the user about no of transitions as its a dfa and no of transitions for each state = no of alphabets
