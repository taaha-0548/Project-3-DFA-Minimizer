1. Implement Hopcroft's Algorithm for DFA Minimization

The current minimization method is just a placeholder. Implementing the full Hopcroft's algorithm would make the program complete.
This would reduce the DFA to its minimal form with the fewest possible states.

2. Add Support for Epsilon Transitions

The current implementation doesn't handle epsilon (Îµ) transitions, which are common in NFAs.
Adding support would require computing epsilon closures when converting NFA to DFA.

3. Add State Renaming

After conversion or minimization, rename states to a more readable format (q0, q1, etc.).
This would make the resulting automaton easier to understand.
